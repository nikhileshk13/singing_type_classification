# Vocal Type Classification
<br>
In this project I have created a vocal type classification system. I have used vggish model to get embedding for the input data and then created a custom artificial neural network model to get the final classification output. <br>
These are the following 17 different vocal types that the model can identify -:
* Belt
* Breathy
* Fast Forte
